# Monopoly-Game
Self Imposed Project
This project will try to recreate a customizable game of Monopoly through java.
My main inspiration for this project was the PS4/5 virtual versions of the game
which allows players to have different rulesets, a custom board, singleplayer with
ai, and multiplayer with up to 6 players. 

Learning Experiences with this project:
  - File reading to acheive custom boards and die
  - AI/nonplayer development
  - Expanding on my knowledge of graphical representation
  - APIs for multiplayer
  - (Possible) Networking
